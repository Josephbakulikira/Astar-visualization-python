### About
        Astar algorithm in python using the pygame library, 
        A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, 
        which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, 
        optimality, and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its O(b^d) 
        space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory.
